Task 3 - Using Tuples

Create a tuple with three elements: your favorite movie, song, and book.
Try to change one of the elements (youâ€™ll see why tuples are immutable!).
Print the length of the tuple using the len() function.
Example Output:

Favorite things: ('Inception', 'Bohemian Rhapsody', '1984')
Oops! Tuples cannot be changed.
Length of tuple: 3
