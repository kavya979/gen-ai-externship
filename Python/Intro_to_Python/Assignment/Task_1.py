Task 1 - Variables: Your First Python Intro
Let's start simple! Imagine you're describing yourself (or anyone else you like) using Python variables.

Create a name variable that stores a string (like your name or a fictional character's name).
Create an age variable that stores an integer value.
Create a height variable that stores a floating-point number.

'''
name = " Kavya "
age = 22
height = 5.5

print(f"I'm {name}, an engineering graduate, at {age} years old, standing at {height} feet tall.")
