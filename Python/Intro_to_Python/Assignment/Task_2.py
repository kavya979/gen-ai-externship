Task 2 - Operators: Playing with Numbers
We all love some math, don't we? Okay, maybe not everyone, but trust me, this will be easy and fun!

Pick two numbers, let's say num1 and num2 (you choose the values!).
Perform the following operations on these numbers:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Write your Python code to calculate and display the results with a nice message for each.

'''
num_1 = 56 # First number
num_2 = 43 # Second number
# Addition of the two numbers
print(f"When you add {num_1} with {num_2} its {num_1+num_2}")
# Subtracting the smaller number (Second number) from the larger number (First number)
print(f"When you subtract {num_2} from {num_1} its {num_1-num_2}")
# Multiplication of the two numbers
print(f"When you add {num_1} with itself {num_2} times you get {num_1*num_2}")
# Dividing the larger number (First number) with the smaller number (Second number)
print(f"When you split {num_1} into {num_2} parts, each part is worth {num_1/num_2}")
